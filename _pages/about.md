Hi! I am a first year Ph.D. student of Informatics at Indiana University, at the [Center for Complex Networks and Systems](https://cnets.indiana.edu/) in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering. I am currently supervised by [Prof. Filippo Radicchi](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/filiradi/index.html) as a part of the [Radicchi-Fortunato lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Radicchi-Fortunato-Lab-Filippo-Radicchi) and I work on transportation networks, studying road networks and bridges in the US. I am also working with [Prof. Jacob Foster](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/index.html?Jacob_Foster) to use hyper neural networks and agent-based modelling to study information aggregation and behavior in online prediction markets. 
My research interests lie in Network Science, Complex Systems, and their applications across different systems. 

I received my Master's in Physics at the Bonn-Cologne Graduate School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Bonn in Germany, where I completed my master's thesis on optimal networks supervised by [Prof. Dr. Dirk Witthaut](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/witthaut_d) as a part of the [Energy Networks and Complex Systems Group](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ice/ice-1/research/research-groups/energy-networks-and-complex-systems) at Forschungszentrum Jülich and the University of Cologne. 

Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's in Physics with interdisciplinary studies in Media and Politics at Azim Premji University in Bangalore, India. I specialized in nonlinear dynamics and my undergraduate thesis was on Taylor-Couette flow supervised by [Dr. Kaustubh Manchanda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaustubh-manchanda-18467890/?originalSubdomain=in).
